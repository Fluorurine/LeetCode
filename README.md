## This is a project aims sloving programming problems in multiple programming languages with testing included. The frist group of problems category is **LeetCode**.

More problems sloving platform will be update later.
Note:

- This project aim for storing the solution and testing those with locally test case. You can easily paste those solution to online code submission platform as the code is structured (detailed in each lang readme ).
- This project intended to use for storing the solution from different platform altogether so you can further intergate this with personal note system about your development. (somewhat keep your Git commit history lively :^) )
- It is recommend that you should be experienced with some of those programming language syntax and how their project work in general before keep on with sloving problems.

### Roadmap

- **_Chapter 1_**: Solve problems from NeetCode Recommend tree: [Link](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)

### Installation

#### Window (Http)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fluorurine/LeetCode.git
```

#### Linux (SSH)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Fluorurine/LeetCode.git
```

For reference to a specific language setup, please look inside corresponding directory.

**Currently availabe:** Python, Java, Go

- Why chose Python ? : easy syntax => easy to understand, popular, psuedo code, low learning curve.
- Why chose Java ? : legacy, popular, more memory management, C-like => more control over data, high learning curve legacy popular, more support in project structure than python but verbose syntax.
- Why chose Golang ? : morden, faster, easy than Java, for future, cloud, C-like, pointer, concurency => problems slove with C can be slove with this, learn this for future.
